# Shannon Puno's Portfolio

## Description
This is my personal Portfolio that I created with HTML and CSS bootstrap. The reason I made this was to showcase to potential employers my progress and all of my projects I have done. This is an easy way for me to fully display my projects, resume, contact section, and an about me description all in one place.
